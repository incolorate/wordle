###Wordle clone
 
A clone of the popular game, Wordle, using Javascript. The main objective of the project was to learn about working with APIs.The game is designed to:
-the game's design is centered around guessing a five-letter word received from an API.
*the player's guess is then posted to another API to check whether the word exists in the English vocabulary.
+if the word does exist, we use JavaScript to check if it matches the "word of the day."
-the game works on mobile devices, ensuring that players can enjoy the game seamlessly on any device.
